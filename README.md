# cyberghostVPN-for-ParrotOS

If you're like me and paid for **Cyberghost VPN** as it was one of the few solutions that offerred a linux app, only to have these ghosts evaporate along with your hopes and dreams that it would be a no-effort install, welcome.

I foolishly assumed that a __"Linux client"__ would include all flavors, yet was sorely cast into the ditches and subnets of injustice.

Fear not, I have a **chunky** and **clumsy** solution for you (If you use Parrot and paid for this service.)


Just run the install file and it should be straight gravy.
It took a few times to catch a working VPN the first few times I turned it on but was OK after that.


## USAGE 
For y'all new jacks:
```
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo bash ./install.sh
```
